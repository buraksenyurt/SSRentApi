# SSRentApi (Space Shuttle Rent API)

This is a common use web api written by .Net and we call it "Space Shuttle Rent Service" :D

In general, I often needed to use a service in .net trainings. That's why I wanted to write a general-use service. JWT token support is also available.

Panacea :P

## Setup

```shell

# to use Postgresql
docker run --name postgresql -e POSTGRES_USER=myusername -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword -p 5432:5432 -v /data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -d postgres

```
